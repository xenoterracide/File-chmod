# load_chmod.t

# Since perl v5.14 (or thereabouts), a warning is issued when the autodie
# pragma is used and &File::chmod::chmod doesn't match the prototype of (@)
# that CORE::chmod has.  Adding a prototype to &File::chmod::chmod silences
# the warning.  This test ensures that the prototype doesn't get lost
# somewhere in the future.
